Hi Friends! 
I've just completed my first React project - a fully functional calculator with a history feature! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¢  <br/>

Key Features:  <br/>
âœ…Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) <br/>
âœ…History feature to track previous calculations  <br/>

I invite you to check out the live demo: https://calculator-github-io-ashen.vercel.app/
